# GaussianElimination
C code for gaussian elimination with partial pivoting

This repository contains C code which implements gaussian elimination with partial pivoting.  The main method is in main.c while the algorithm is implemented in gaussian_elimination.c.  The code currently has the following exampled programmed in: Ax = b is solved where A = [2 1 1; 4 -6 0; -2 7 2] and b = [5 -2 9]' which leads to x = [1 1 2]'.
